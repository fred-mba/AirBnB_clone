## AirBnB clone - The console

- This project entails writing a command interpreter to manage AirBnB onbjects
- It comprises of two major parts of web development -- front-end and back-end development
  * Front-end : HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration
  * Back-end : Includes application of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts learned

Each task is linked to:

- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

* The ultimate goal of this project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).
